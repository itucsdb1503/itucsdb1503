Database Design
---------------

Our database consists of 12 tables distributed evenly among 4 members. Individual members have refences between their tables however there are no references between different member's tables.

**Note:** At the beginning of the project we distributed topics among the team members. However one of our members ended up not participating in the project. We didn't know if he would start the project at any point so we didn't refence other members tables in our tables. As the project deadline came closer we gave up on connecting tables to each other where possible because everybody had made different adjustments.
